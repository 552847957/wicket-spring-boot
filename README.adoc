= Wicket autoconfiguration with Spring Boot

This project (should) makes it easy to create Wicket projects with a minimum
of configuration effort. Is uses Spring Boot to autoconfigure Wickets core and
extension with an reasonable default value which can be overridden over property files.

This project detects classes in external dependencies and tries to configure
it in a reasonable way.

== Getting started

To get started you have to create a new Maven (or another preferred dependency/build-management tool)
and add the *wicket-spring-boot-starter* dependency to your configuration. This dependency is
responsibly to configure you application in a default way.  

[source,yml]
----
include::wicket-spring-boot-starter/src/main/resources/application-development.yml[]
----

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.giffing.wicket.spring.boot.starter</groupId>
	<artifactId>wicket-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
	<version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Beside the Maven dependency configuration we need the following steps to do

. Create a class (e.g. WicketApplication) with a main method
. Annotate the class with @WicketSpringBootApplication
. Extend this class with WicketBootWebApplication
. Use the SpringApplicationBuilder to run the WicketApplication class


[source,java]
----
@WicketSpringBootApplication
public class WicketApplication extends WicketBootWebApplication {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    new SpringApplicationBuilder()
      .sources(WicketApplication.class)
      .run(args);
  }
}
----

Thats all! When you execute the main method you will get a fully working and configured 
Wicket application with a simple Login Page. As in every Wicket Application you can override the 
WicketBootWebApplication as usual. You can change the Login/Home-Page or the *init()* Method to 
register other extensions. 

== Extensions

The following section describes the current autoconfigurations and there
required dependencies.
